Disclaimer: UPRM Projects on this Repository

The projects and code presented in this repository are original works. They were completed as part of UPRM's academic requirements. The purpose of sharing these projects on this GitHub repository is to showcase my skills and development as a programmer.

While I encourage learning, I want to make it clear that copying or submitting any part or entirety of these projects as your own work for academic or any other purposes is considered plagiarism and goes against ethical standards. It is important to understand that using someone else's work without proper attribution or authorization is not only dishonest but can also have serious consequences in an educational and professional context.

If you find these projects interesting and helpful for your learning, I encourage you to use them as references or sources of inspiration. Feel free to explore the code and ideas presented here to gain insights into programming techniques and problem-solving strategies. However, I strongly urge you to use this content responsibly and with integrity.

Remember that academic institutions and employers value originality and the ability to independently develop solutions. It's in your best interest to create your own projects from scratch to fully grasp the concepts and skills being taught.
